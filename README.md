# EchoFi_Pocket_Server.
# Just created a Hardware Pentest Device by "ESP8266 D1 Mini" and its name  'EchoFi_Pocket _Server'. You can say, It's a pocket-jackpot hacking device. It is small but effective. Let me tell u why,

Category: Portable Penetration Testing Device

Size: Compact and Portable
      
Overview:::

EchoFi_Pocket_Server is a compact and portable penetration testing tool designed for cybersecurity professionals and ethical hackers. This device is built to assess and analyze  networks, identify vulnerabilities, and perform advanced security tests. With three essential tools integrated, it provides a comprehensive approach to network security auditing. 

This device contains "Mr.EchoFi Server" & inside this server you will see three comprehensive tools -[ Scan, Deauth , Evil twin attack ].

And yeah, this device created for educational purpose. 

# Features & Functionalities::::::::::\/

1. Scan Tool->
Captures surrounding Wi-Fi networks, collecting details such as:

 ~SSID (Network Name)

 ~Channel (CH) Information

 ~RSSI (Signal Strength Indicator)

Monitors network traffic, packets, and signal strength to analyze security risks.
Provides real-time insights into network activity for auditing and assessment.

2. Deauthentication (Deauth) Attack Tool->

Disrupts communication between legitimate users and the targeted network.
Prevents devices from maintaining a stable connection, making it difficult or impossible to connect.

 ~Useful for testing network resilience against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

3. Evil Twin Attack Tool ->

Creates a rogue access point (AP) that mimics a legitimate network.

By this attack you can typically sets up a rogue AP with the same name and security settings as the legitimate AP, and then tricks users into connecting to the fake AP. Once connected, the attacker can intercept and monitor traffic, stealing sensitive data or sensitive information. 

### Note: 1] Arduino IDE & ESP IDF Compatible.
###       2] This project isn't open source that's why if u Need Source code? Contact with me--> tanjibisham777@gmail.com

# Use Case:
This tool for penetration testers, security researchers, and IT professionals looking to evaluate the security of fidelity networks. Its portable design ensures ease of use in various environments, making it a reliable companion for ethical hacking and vulnerability  assessments.
